This started out, or currently is still, just a way to digitise my old school notebook scribblings.

I am not a writter or a philosopher. I'm, also, not a politician or an activist. I just have ideas that are, mostly, not shit. I mostly debate these with just myself and this might just be my [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).
