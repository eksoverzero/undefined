# Blog

Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Theme

The blog uses the [jekyll-console-theme](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console), but because GitHub Pages doesn't seem to like this gem theme, it's been copied locally.

TODO: Setup a GitHub Action to alert when the theme is updated so that those changes can be copied locally.
