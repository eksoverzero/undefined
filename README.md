# Undefined

A blog built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Running things

```bash
jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_local.yml
```

## Theme

The blog uses the [minimalist](https://github.com/Trybnetic/minimalist), theme, but because GitHub Pages doesn't seem to like this gem theme, it's been copied locally.

TODO: Setup a GitHub Action to alert when the theme is updated so that those changes can be copied locally.
