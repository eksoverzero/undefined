Written in the form of police reports, autopsy reports and personal diary entries that tells the story of the physical consequences of the philosophical idea of creating super-humans.

## Plot

Unsure.

## Format

I'm not entirely sure a format like T.V's "mockumentary" could work in the written form. It does, however, create an interesting opportunity to play with A.Is.

Using A.I, the story can give each character a unique hand writing or writing pattern like spelling mistakes, grammar and maybe even syntax for the written reports that tell the story. The bigger project, then, could be to tell the story on a blog. Then A.I could potentially be used to generate character faces and possibly even voices for video diary entries instead of written ones.

## Research
