I don't really have a summary of this yet.

The basic idea is to tell the story of the world left behind by time travellers if the current time-line can never see changes to history and the travellers can never return to their original time-line. 

I like the idea of telling little, unlinked, stories about those travellers. Short stories maybe from different authors.

## Plot

Unsure.

## Research
